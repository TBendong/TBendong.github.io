    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am Xingyi Yang. I will be joining The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (DSAI) in Fall 2025, supported by the Presidential Young Scholar Scheme. I recently obtained my Ph.D. from the National University of Singapore (NUS).</p>
    <p>I am establishing a new research group dedicated to cutting-edge AI, with a focus on Generative AI, Multimodal Learning, Efficient AI, and Agentic AI. I am looking for passionate Ph.D. students for Spring/Fall 2026 admission, as well as visiting students, RAs, and Postdocs.</p>

    <h2>Educational Background</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Ph.D., National University of Singapore (Advisor: Prof. Xinchao Wang). Visiting researcher at University of Oxford (Prof. Philip Torr).</li>
        <li>M.S., University of California San Diego</li>
        <li>B.Eng., Southeast University</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Research & Honors</h2>
    <p>My research focuses on Generative AI, Multimodal Learning, and Efficient AI, particularly their application to 3D/4D vision and physical world modeling. My work has been published in top-tier venues, including NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, CVPR, ICCV, and ECCV, and has received honors such as the NeurIPS 2022 Best Paper Honorable Mention and the 2023 Chinese Government Award for Outstanding Self-Financed Students Abroad.</p>

    <h2 class="emoji">üí° Research Interests</h2>
    <p>Our research aims to tackle fundamental challenges in AI by building smarter and more efficient systems that can understand and interact with the physical world. Key directions include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Generative AI:</strong> Investigating structured generative models (e.g., Diffusion Models, LLMs) for content creation, scene modeling, and understanding.</li>
        <li><strong>Multimodal Learning:</strong> Fusing text, image, video, and 3D data to build intelligent systems that can perceive and interact with the physical world.</li>
        <li><strong>Efficient AI:</strong> Focusing on the computational efficiency, optimization, and adaptation of large pre-trained models.</li>
        <li><strong>Agentic AI:</strong> Exploring agents that can perceive, plan, and collaborate to autonomously solve complex tasks.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These areas are interrelated: <span class="emoji">ü§ñ</span> generative models provide general capabilities, <span class="emoji">üåê</span> multimodal learning enhances understanding of the real world, <span class="emoji">‚ö°</span> efficient AI ensures practical deployment, and <span class="emoji">üß†</span> agentic systems enable autonomous behavior and feedback.</p>
