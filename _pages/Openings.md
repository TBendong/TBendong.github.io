<p><strong>Dr. Bendong Tan is now recruiting fully funded Ph.D. students (Spring/Fall 2026) and visiting students in power systems. Undergraduate and Master’s students are also welcome to join the group for research internships.</strong></p>

<div class="faculty-profile">
    <h4>About Me</h4>
    <p>Before joining PolyU, Dr. Tan was a postdoctoral research associate at the University of Connecticut and a visiting scientist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, working with <a href="https://engineering.dartmouth.edu/community/faculty/junbo-zhao">Dr. Junbo Zhao</a> 
and 
<a href="https://energy.mit.edu/profile/deepjyoti-deka/">Dr. Deepjyoti Deka</a>. 
He received his Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Connecticut in 2024, advised by 
<a href="https://engineering.dartmouth.edu/community/faculty/junbo-zhao">Dr. Junbo Zhao</a>.  Prior to that, he earned an M.S. (2020) and a B.Eng. (2017) in Electrical Engineering from Wuhan University.</p>
    <p>Dr. Tan’s research focuses on the modeling, stability assessment, and control of inverter-penetrated stochastic power systems, with related work published in leading journals such as IEEE Transactions on Power Systems. He has received the 2023 Chinese Government Award for Outstanding Self-financed Students Abroad, the GE Fellowship for Excellence at the University of Connecticut, and the Ezra Postdoctoral Associate Fellowship at Cornell University. He is also a recipient of multiple awards, including Best Paper Awards at the IEEE PES General Meetings in 2021, 2022, and 2024, the Best Journal Paper Award from the International Journal of Electrical Power & Energy Systems in 2022, and the Outstanding Reviewer Award from IEEE Transactions on Power Systems (2021–2023).</p>

    <h4>Research Interests</h4>
    <p>The group focuses on <strong>modeling/monitoring, stability assessment, and control of inverter-penetrated stochastic power systems</strong>. We are particularly interested in the areas, including but not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Dynamic power system modeling, including dynamic load and inverter-based resources</li>
        <li>Inverter-penetrated power system inertia estimation and tracking</li>
        <li>Static and dynamic power system risk assessment with high penetration of inverter-based resources</li>
        <li>Stochastic power system decision-making and control</li>
        <li>Applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning in power system analysis and control</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you have interesting ideas in other research areas, I am open to discussing them.</p>
