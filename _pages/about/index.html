I received my Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Connecticut, advised by <a href="https://engineering.dartmouth.edu/community/faculty/junbo-zhao" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Dr. Junbo Zhao</a>. Before my Ph.D. studies at UConn, I received my M.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from Wuhan University in 2020 and my B.Eng. degree in Electrical Engineering from Wuhan University in 2017. </p> <p> My long-term vision is to advance power system resilience against uncertainties. Currently, I focus on modeling/monitoring, stability assessment and control for stochastic inverter-penetrated power systems. My research interests include but are not limited to: </p> <ul> <li>Dynamic power system modeling, including dynamic load and inverter-based resources</li> <li>Inverter-penetrated power system inertia estimation and tracking</li> <li>Static/dynamic power system risk assessment with high penetration of inverter-based resources</li> <li>Stochastic power system decision-making and control</li> <li>Applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning in power system analysis and control</li> </ul> <p><strong> I am open to research discussions and collaborations.
