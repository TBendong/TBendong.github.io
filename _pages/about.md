As a Senior Research Scientist at **Kunlun Tech**, I lead a team developing cutting-edge large multimodal models, with expertise in Diffusion and VLM technologies. My tenure at **Meituan's Autonomous Delivery Department** as a Research Scientist equipped me with a robust understanding of real-world applications of AI.

I obtained my Ph.D. degree from School of Artificial Intelligence and Automation, **Huazhong University of Science and Technology** in 2021, under the expert guidance of [Prof. Nong Sang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ky_ZowEAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and [Prof. Changxin Gao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4tku-lwAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). My academic journey was further enriched by a visiting Ph.D. position at the Australian Institute for Machine Learning, **University of Adelaide**, where I worked closely with [Prof. Chunhua Shen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ljk2BvIAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). During my doctoral studies, I received the **Excellent Doctoral Dissertation Award** (one of only 10 students in the country).

My industry experience includes being a research intern at **Microsoft Research Asia** and **Megvii (Face++)**, where I collaborated with [Dr. Jingdong Wang](https://jingdongwang2017.github.io/), [Dr. Gang Yu](https://www.skicyyu.org/), and [Dr. Jian Sun](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ALVSZAYAAAAJ&hl=en). I was part of the winning team at the COCO & Mapillary Panoptic Segmentation Challenge 2018.
