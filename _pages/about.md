<p>
Currently, I am a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Connecticut and a visiting scientist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, working with advised by 
<a href="https://engineering.dartmouth.edu/community/faculty/junbo-zhao">Dr. Junbo Zhao</a> 
and 
<a href="https://energy.mit.edu/profile/deepjyoti-deka/">Dr. Deepjyoti Deka</a>. 
I received my Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Connecticut, advised by 
<a href="https://engineering.dartmouth.edu/community/faculty/junbo-zhao">Dr. Junbo Zhao</a>. 
Before my Ph.D. studies at UConn, I received my M.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from Wuhan University in 2020 and my B.Eng. degree in Electrical Engineering from Wuhan University in 2017.
</p>

<p>
My research interests lie in dynamic modeling/monitoring, stability assessment and control for inverter-integrated power systems, with a focus on dynamic load/inverter-based resource modeling, inertia estimation, static/dynamic risk assessment, uncertainty quantification and management, and machine learning applications. 
In the past five years, I have published over 30 research papers at prestigious journals and conferences, such as TPWRS.
</p>


<strong>I am open to research discussions and collaborations. Feel free to reach out to me via email!</strong>

<p>
    <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Openings for 26 Spring/Fall</span>: I'm actively looking for Postdoc and Ph.D. students to work with me. 
    Feel free to drop me an email (bendong.tan@uconn.edu) with the subject "{Postdoc|PhD}-{Your Name}" (e.g., PhD-Jiacheng Shen) with your CV and transcripts attached, if you are interested. 
    Check <a href="#openings">openings</a> for more details.
